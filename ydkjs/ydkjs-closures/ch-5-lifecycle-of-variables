When can I use a variable?

The most obvious answer might seem to be: As soon as it's decalred, like this:

let greeting = "Hi!";
conosle.log(greeting); // reference error

But this also works:

greeting();
// Hello!

function greeting() {
    console.log("Hello!");
}

This is due to a function hoisting. Funciton joisting applies only to formal function declaration.

What is hoisting? It's registration of variables on top of the program. 
var, function, const and let are hoisted, eg registered at the top, but!
var is hoisted and initialized to undefined, but it's not the same as var myVar = undefined
function is hoisted on top and autoreferenced to the value, so you can call it before defenition
const and let are hoisted as well, but can't be accessed since they are in a Tempraly Dead Zone.

Best practice is to put all variable declarations at the top.
