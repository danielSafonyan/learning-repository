A branch is a reference to a commit.

A commit is a snapshot of staged content.

When creating a new branch - make sure you are creating a new branch from a branch your new branch will be based on.

git branch new-branch command lets you create a new branch 

git switch new-branch command lets you switch to a new branch 

Every time you switch branches, Git rewrites your working directory to look like it did when you made the most recent commit on the branch you just switched to.

git switch -c new-branch command lets you create a new branch and switch to it in one step.

To merge branch switch to an "integration" branch and use git merge feature-branch command.

To delete a branch, we supply the -d (or --delete) flag to git branch along with the name of the branch we wish to delete

git branch -d branch-name
