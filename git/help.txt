Git by default uses a “pager” for displaying long outputs. It's a program that only displays one page of text at a time. You can use your cursor keys to navigate up and down the page one line at a time. Once you are done, hit the letter “q,” which stands for “quit,” and your terminal will be restored back to the prompt.
